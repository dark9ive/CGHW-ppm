# CGHW01

This is my first CG(Computer Graphics) homework. The main goal is to practice some basic skills in computer graphics.

## Operating enviornment

All of the development and testing are under the following enviornments:

 - OS: Ubuntu 18.04
 - g++ version: g++ 7.4.0

## Usage

Please use the following commands to compile this project:

```
g++ ./main.cpp
```

the executable may ask you about some options like the color of the ball.  
The picture generated is only in ppm format currently, planned on adding more file formats.
